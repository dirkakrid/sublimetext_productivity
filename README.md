sublimetext_productivity
=======================

a small collection of plugins I find useful


-  `printifier` makes it easy to turn

        some_variable_name
        into 
        print(`some_variable_name`, some_variable_name)
        
-  `stringifier` ...(explanation todo)...
-  `sublime_to_gist` copies whatever is in the selection to a new anonymous gist, OAuth2 version seems a 
little overkill -- if i really want to have gist associated with my account I can fork the anonymous one.
-  `url_opener` opens any selected text in a new browser window (useful for hyperlink or search terms).
